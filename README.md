This script will copy all videos and screenshots from a Nintendo Switch's SD card and organize them in folders named after the game. All automatically!

Originally written for personal use, I found it to be quite useful and decided to do some changes in order to share it. This might be a work in progress if more features are needed and how useful it proves to be for me and others. You can see the code in the ".py" file or just download the zip which contains the executable and the list of IDs.


How to use

- Download the sw2pc.zip file
- Unzip it
- Make sure you have connected your Switch's SD card to your computer or copied the "Nintendo" folder to your C drive or other drive's main folder.
- Run the sw2pc.exe file. The drive where the screenshots/videos are located will be detected automatically and the program will give you further instructions.
